# MultiLabel_Image_Classifier
I have writtern the code in jupyter notebook using python language. I have used the bulk download chrome extension to download the images, to make it simple for readers to understand. We begin our code from preprocessing step till the prediction.
Most of the online materials available are for standard datasets like cat_vs_dog, cifar, iris, etc,. In this I have build a image classifier for the avengers characters where our model will train and predict on different marvel characters. 
We also build a model architecture mimicking the standard models like VGG, Resnet, etc,.
Just use !pip install to install the packages mentioned in case you dont have one.
