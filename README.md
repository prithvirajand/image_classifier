# MultiLabel_Image_Classifier
I have writtern the code in jupyter notebook using python language. I have used the bulk download chrome extension to download the images, to make it simple for readers to understand. We begin our code from preprocessing step till the prediction.
Most of the online materials available are for standard datasets like cat_vs_dog, cifar, iris, etc,. In this we will build a image classifier for custom dataset where our model will train and predict on different datasets of individuals choice. 
We also build a model architecture mimicking the standard models like VGG, Resnet, etc,.
Just use !pip install to install the packages mentioned in case you dont have one.

Im going to build a simple dress classifier where our labels will be black_jeans, black_shirt, blue_jeans and blue_shirt. Remember it could be any classes and I leave it to your own creativity
since I have focused more on simplifying the project for easy understanding.
